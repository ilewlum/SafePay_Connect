```

#### Step 2: Send Money

2. **Navigate to Wallet** → Tap "Send Money"
3. **Enter payment details:**
   - Recipient: @janesmith (or just janesmith)
   - Amount: 100.00
   - Reference: Test payment
4. **Confirm** the payment
5. **Success!** Transaction created

#### Step 3: View Transaction

1. **Pull to refresh** on Wallet screen
2. **See transaction** in history (shows as sent/red)
3. **Tap transaction** to view details
4. **Verify** all information is correct

#### Step 4: Verify Transaction

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid User" error when sending
**Solution**: Ensure recipient username exists (not email)

### Issue: "Sender has no wallet"
**Solution**: Create wallet first before sending money

### Issue: Transaction not showing in history
**Solution**: Pull to refresh wallet screen

### Issue: Verification fails
**Solution**: Only verify your own transactions (sent or received)

## Testing with cURL

```bash
# Get token for sender
TOKEN1=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}' \
  -s | python -m json.tool | grep token | cut -d'"' -f4)

# Create transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/createTransaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN1" \
  -d '{"username":"janesmith","amount":100,"reference":"Test payment"}'

# Get transaction (replace TX_ID)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/getTransaction/TX_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN1"
```
